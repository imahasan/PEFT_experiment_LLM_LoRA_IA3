# PEFT_experiment_LLM_LoRA_IA3
This repository is created to do the experiemt of my final thesis work where I am fine tuning CodeGen-2B pre-trained LLM with a dataset on C and C++ codes curated from CVEFixes (v1.0.7) dataset and further fine tuned by the research paper "Scope: Evaluating llms for software vulnerability detection". The dataset was further finetuned to allign this experiment where I are considering only safe C and C++ codes for fine tuning the selected LLM. The ultimate goal of the experiment is to improve the safe code generation capability of a pre-trained through PEFT fien tuning.
